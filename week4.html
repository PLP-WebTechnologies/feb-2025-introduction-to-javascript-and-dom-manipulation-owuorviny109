        <h2>Junior Software Developer</h2>
        <p>This journey as a technology student taking software engineering at PLP has been incredibly rewarding. It has taught me
        more than just programming—it has taught me resilience, problem-solving, and the importance of a growth mindset. As I
        continue to build my career, I’m excited to tackle new challenges and explore new opportunities in the world of software
        engineering.
        
        To anyone who is starting their journey in software engineering, remember that the road may be tough, but the rewards
        are worth it. Stay curious, stay persistent, and embrace the learning process. The tech world is waiting for the next
        generation of innovators, and I’m ready to be part of that revolution.</p>
